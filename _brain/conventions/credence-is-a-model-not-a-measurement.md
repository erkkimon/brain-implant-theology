title: Credence is a model, not a measurement
description: Numeric probabilities attached to hypotheses in this implant are the output of a stated, replayable model — a decomposition into factors, a prior, and explicit likelihood ratios with their justifications — never a claim to have measured a truth; the contribution is the structure and its defensible inputs, so any reader can substitute their own numbers and recompute, and the spread of results across reasonable inputs is itself the report on how much of a belief is evidence and how much is faith.

# Credence is a model, not a measurement

Decided by Tom on 2026-09-24 ([journal](../journals/2026-09-24.md)):

> *"If somebody wants to use different probabilities for the factors, they
> can calculate the probability they believe based on the factors they think
> are true. Everything is replicable."*

That is the whole justification, and it survives the usual objection. The
objection — *"you cannot know that the probability the empty tomb was a
genuine historical event is 12 %"* — is correct and beside the point,
because the number was never the claim.

## What is actually being published

**The model, not the number.** A credence in this implant is a small,
inspectable artifact with four parts:

1. **A decomposition** — what has to hold for the claim to be true, stated
   as named factors. This is the real intellectual contribution and the part
   that can be wrong in interesting ways.
2. **A prior** — with its reference class named. "Reported events from
   antiquity of a kind that, if they occurred, would leave the kind of
   trace we have" is a reference class; a number alone is not.
3. **Likelihood ratios** — for each piece of evidence, how much more
   expected that observation is if the claim holds than if it does not, with
   the reasoning and a citation.
4. **A provenance record** — who assigned each input, on what date, from
   what source, and whether it is cited, derived or elicited judgement
   ([receipts](every-claim-carries-its-receipt.md)).

A reader who disagrees does not have to argue about the conclusion. They
change the input they object to and recompute. Everything downstream moves
automatically, and the disagreement is now *located* — at factor 3, say,
rather than somewhere in a paragraph of prose. That is a far better
epistemic position than two essays talking past each other, and it is why
this is worth doing even though none of the numbers are measurements.

## The rule

1. **Every credence ships with its model.** A bare probability in prose is
   forbidden. The number appears with, or links to, the decomposition and
   inputs that produced it. A number nobody can replay is decoration.
2. **Every input is labelled by kind** — `cited` (a measured or published
   value), `derived` (computed from cited inputs), or `elicited` (this
   brain's judgement, with its reasoning written out). The proportions of
   each kind across a model are themselves reported: a model built from
   twelve elicited inputs is a different object from one built from ten
   cited ones, and the reader must be able to see which they are holding.
3. **Never a single number.** A credence is reported as a range across
   defensible inputs, with the point estimate as one value inside it.
   Reporting `0.12` invites a precision that does not exist; reporting
   `0.02–0.35, point 0.12 under the default inputs` is honest and just as
   actionable.
4. **Sensitivity is mandatory output.** Every model reports which factor
   dominates the result. If moving one input across its plausible range
   swings the posterior more than all others combined, that factor is the
   real subject and the page says so.
5. **Never assign 0 or 1** (Cromwell's rule). A factor at 0 makes all
   evidence powerless against it; a factor at 1 makes it unfalsifiable.
   Certainty about an empirical claim is not available and the tool refuses
   it.
6. **Do not Bayesianise what is measured.** See below — this is the rule
   most likely to be broken by enthusiasm.

## Bayes is for the joints, not for the facts

The most common abuse of this machinery is applying it to questions that
have answers. Whether a particular first-century text is internally
consistent is not a matter of belief: it is a measurement question, and it
has a published answer with an uncertainty attached. Wrapping it in a
subjective probability replaces a hard fact with a soft one and makes the
implant *worse* than the literature it was built from.

So: **cited facts go in as facts, with their published uncertainties.**
Credence modelling applies to the joints between them — the extrapolations,
the "does this testimony support that inference", the "would a later
redactor have had motive to alter this", the steps where the evidence
genuinely runs out and judgement begins. Those joints are exactly what the
brief called *faith*, and putting a number on them is how the faith gets
measured instead of merely admitted.

Where a model assigns a credence to something that has a citable measured
answer, that is a defect in the model.

## Odds form, because it makes disagreement local

Credences here are computed in odds form:

    posterior odds = prior odds × LR₁ × LR₂ × … × LRₙ

and reported in log-odds as well, where the multiplications become
additions. Two reasons, both practical:

- **A likelihood ratio is a local judgement.** "How much more expected is
  this observation if the claim is true than if it is false?" is a question
  about one piece of evidence, answerable by someone who knows that
  evidence. "What is the probability that the empty tomb was a genuine
  historical event?" is a question about everything at once, answerable by
  nobody. Eliciting the local quantities honestly is achievable; eliciting
  the global one is not.
- **In log-odds, the contributions are additive and comparable.** The
  evidence that moved a belief can be shown as a ranked list — this
  manuscript witness added +1.2 bits, this dating problem subtracted −3.0 —
  which is a far more useful summary than the posterior alone.

## The multiplication trap

A decomposition into many factors that are then multiplied will produce a
tiny number almost regardless of the inputs: ten factors at 0.7 multiply to
0.028. This is a known failure — the same arithmetic that makes naive Drake
equation estimates collapse — and it has two distinct causes, both of which
this implant handles explicitly.

- **Correlation.** Factors are usually not independent, because they share
  hidden causes ("our source-critical method is right", "the textual
  transmission is reliable"). Multiplying correlated factors double-counts
  the same doubt repeatedly. A model must either state that its factors are
  conditionally independent *and defend it*, or model the shared cause as
  its own node and condition on it.
- **Point estimates instead of distributions.** Multiplying best guesses
  discards the probability that several factors are simultaneously at the
  optimistic end. Propagating distributions — a Monte Carlo over the input
  ranges — gives a different and much wider answer than multiplying the
  midpoints, and the difference is often orders of magnitude.

So the machinery propagates distributions by default, and a decomposition
with more than a handful of multiplied factors is treated as a smell to be
justified rather than a sign of rigour.

## The payoff: faith and evidence, separated numerically

The brief asked how much of a claim stands on hard evidence and how much on
faith. A sensitivity analysis answers that *quantitatively*, which prose
cannot:

- If the posterior stays within a narrow band across every defensible choice
  of prior and factor, the **evidence is carrying the conclusion**. Readers
  with different starting beliefs converge. That is what a well-evidenced
  claim looks like.
- If the posterior swings from near-zero to near-certain across choices that
  reasonable people would make, the conclusion is **prior-dominated** — it
  is being carried by what the assessor believed before looking. That is
  what faith looks like, stated precisely, without insulting anyone.

Every appraisal in this implant therefore reports its prior-sensitivity, and
that figure — not the headline credence — is the honest summary of how much
is known. A claim whose assessment swings on the assessor's temperament has
been *characterised*, which is the useful result, even though it has not
been settled.

## What this does not claim

It does not claim the numbers are objective, that the decomposition is the
only sensible one, or that a posterior is a forecast anyone should bet on
without reading the model. It claims something narrower and defensible: that
a belief with a stated structure and stated inputs is inspectable,
criticisable and replayable, and a belief expressed as confident prose is
none of those things.

Calibration is the long-term check — where a model's claims resolve, the
record is kept and scored, because a credence machine that is never scored
against outcomes is a rhetoric machine.

And, as [Evidence before authority](evidence-before-authority.md) requires,
the evidence — and only the evidence — is what carries the conclusion:
`Evidence.from_absence` (absence of expected evidence) is a valid likelihood
ratio, but it is still evidence, not authority.
